## Registration

Why is there not just one registration page? Because we allow teams and organizations
to self-organize their registration process and some organizations prefer that.

<div class="alert alert-info">

[General registration](https://indico.neic.no/event/226/) (Anyone worldwide may
register here for basic online attendance with no obligation.  You may
be interested in one of the following special attendee groups, in
which case you don't need to register here, but still can):
- Aalto University: please register via the main form. You can also join us live in Otaniemi, see below.
- [Jyväskylä University](https://indico.neic.no/event/233/) (In-person
  exercise and mentor group)

  a team and you can provide an exercise leader, please contact
  [Paula Martinez Lavanchy](mailto:p.m.martinezlavanchy@tudelft.nl).

</div>

**If you want to join as organization** to provide local helpers or
in-person sessions, please do!  This usually takes the form of a
"watching party" with coordinated breaks for exercises.  You can
manage that on your own and all
we will ask you is to [register the teams and their contact
point](https://indico.neic.no/event/226/registrations/124/) with us. Later
(during or after the workshop) we will ask you to give us actual participation
numbers and also provide us with the affiliation contry/countries of the
participants and their career stage/ job type.  If it is helpful for your
organization, we can also list your registration link here.


## Course goals

In this course, you will become familiar with tools and best practices
for scientific software development. This course will not teach a programming language, but we teach the tools you need
to do programming well and avoid common inefficiency traps.
The tools we teach are
practically a requirement for any scientist that has to do their own programming. The main
focus is on using Git for efficiently writing and maintaining research
software.

## Format

This is an informal and interactive event with type-along lessons,
live coding, and exercises. Learners are divided into exercise teams for
interactivity - register with a friend!  If you feel a bit more
confident in the material, you can [register as an exercise
leader](volunteer/).

The workshop will be held online, see options at [how to
join](join/):

* Everyone watches the main teaching via a livestream at
  <https://twitch.tv/coderefinery>.  If you
  register, you can get emails and link to ask questions.

* The reason why we stream the main workshop via Twitch and not via Zoom is
  that this way we can guarantee that learners cannot appear in stream or
  recording with voice or video.

* You can also register to attend our Zoom breakout rooms (limited
  places), and you will be placed into a small, interactive breakout
  room.  Please only register for Zoom if you want to actively take
  part in the exercises ([read more](join/)).

* Some partners offer in-person breakout rooms and help, see below.

**Before signing up** please also read
[this privacy note about tools/services we use](requirements/#privacy-and-tools-online-services).

## Certificates and credits

It is possible to obtain a certificate from the course with a little extra work. 
The certificate is equivalent to 1 ECTS and your study supervisor will be able to register it as a credit in your university study credit system.
**Please make sure that your supervisor/study program accepts it**.

Learners with a valid Aalto student number will automatically get the credit registered in Aalto systems.
Please note that this does not apply to participants affiliated with TU Delft
who have own criteria for workshop certificates and credits.

To obtain a certificate, we expect you to follow the 6 days of the course and provide us with the following three documents via email:

1. The output of `git log --all` from the repositories that you have used during the course as a text file. Evaluation criteria: we expect to see the results from most of the git commands that are run in the first 3 days of the workshop.
2. Written answers to the following four questions submitted as a document (pdf or word or txt). Evaluation criteria: we expect critical answers related to the content of first 3 days with both pros and cons (when relevant):
    - When should you work with branches?
    - What is the difference between a `git clone` and a `git fork`?
    - What is the difference between a fork and a branch?
    - What advantages and disadvantages to code review can you imagine/list?
3. A personal reflection for each of the 6 days written as a document (pdf or word or txt, one paragraph per day). To get started, you can try answering the questions "Why is this important? How can it improve my research work?", however any other personal reflection is welcome. Evaluation criteria: we expect reflections that are related to the content of each of the six days.

These three documents should be sent before 30/October/2022 23:59CET to one of the following email addresses. If you are from a Swedish institution you may email diana.iusan@uppmax.uu.se. If you are from other countries please email enrico.glerean@aalto.fi. If the evaluation criteria are met for each of the 3 documents, you will receive a certificate by mid November 2022. Please note that we do not track course attendance.
