dear all,

We are quickly approaching the final day of the workshop. Thank you again for the active participation.

Tomorrow we will go through software testing and modular code development. I hope we can convey to you why testing and modularity can be important ingredients to manage code complexity and to improve reusability of your code for you and for others. We will need the Conda environment again. No new tools.

Tomorrow we plan two exercise sessions:
- https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/pytest/
- https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/test-design/ (any of the design exercises)

The modular code development session will be done as demo/"improv" but we will try to make it really engaging and we hope you ask lots of questions and give us many comments via the collaborative document.

After the modular session, if you have time and are interested, we plan an informal and optional
"meet the instructors" and ask-us-anything/ discussion session after 12:30 CEST in (**link**).
