dear all, (team representatives can you please forward?)

Thank you for joining the workshop on day 2! It looks like our new solution with HackMD [1] works nicely and we will use this for the rest of the workshop.  We finished the git-intro lesson, if you would like to catch up.

Link to videos, Q&A, and more news can be found on our website:

**Info about day 3**

We continue with "collaborative git", where you will really see how git comes together in teams.  You'll see the method for both small teams, and large projects.  People who know some git can easily start joining this day - invite your colleagues!

If you don't have a team, please see the next session to request access for an exercise tomorrow.
 

**Information for stream participants who practice on their own**

On Thursday we will all practice how to collaborate using Git/GitHub [2] and one
ambitious thing we will try is to collaborate with participants following
via stream. This does not apply to teams and exercise groups who will create their
own exercise repositories and these groups can ignore the rest of this section.

For this to work we will need to give you access to a practice repository.  This is option, you could just watch instead. We delete these repositories after the workshop and will not use your username for anything other than this exercise.

If you would like to participate in this, could you please open an issue here.  Give any title like "please add me" and then click submit:
- https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise/issues/new

Example for how I requested access:
- https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise/issues/1


**Information to exercise leads**

Since we are so spread over different in-person/zoom and breakout room sessions, it is very appreciated if you can give us feedback how today went in your "team". You can use the HackMD feedback section for that. What can we improve?

We will continue tomorrow with the material in git-intro (https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/), starting from https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/conflicts/. 

We plan for two exercise sessions:
- https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/centralized/#exercise-preparation
- https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/distributed/#exercise-preparation

best regards and see you tomorrow,

Matias and the CodeRefinery team
