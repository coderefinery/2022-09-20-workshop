Dear all,

Thank you for being an exercise leader for the CodeRefinery workshop starting next week :heart:

The information below is for those who could not join the exercise leader on-boarding session but also hopefully a useful summary for those who have:

- Everyone will watch the course via Twitch stream (https://twitch.tv/coderefinery) showing the instructors going through the material
- Some of you registered as a team, you will stay together during the duration of the workshop, and if you are participating via our learner zoom [1], you will find your team in a breakoutroom named after your team (used during registration)
- For those who did not register as a team, you can join one of the open rooms called open-group-X at [1]
- There will also be rooms named help-room-X which can be used for one-on-one help, if needed
- Whether your team is in a physical or virtual space, you will spend time with the learners during exercise sessions, and help learners getting through exercises, by answering or relaying questions to HackMD (see below), keeping the time and creating a positive learning environment.
- Exercises are distributed all through the lesson material and we will have 2-3 exercises per half-day, a detailed schedule (with approximate exercise times) will be available in HackMD during the course
- Exercises will be typically 15-20 minutes (sometimes more) to give the group time to orient
- HackMD is our collaborative document [2] for the course and we use it to:
    * ask and answer questions
    * communicate with instructors in stream (they don't see/hear learners)
    * ask for help
    * communicate breakout room status during exercises
- You can read more about how we use HackMD here: https://coderefinery.org/manuals/hackmd-mechanics/
- You can find all this information and much more in our manuals: https://coderefinery.org/manuals/exercise-leaders/

One thing you can do before the workshop to prepare is to have a look at exercises for each lesson:

- You can find all lesson material from the links in the schedule: https://coderefinery.github.io/2022-09-20-workshop/schedule/
- You can either go through the material and find the green boxes with Exercise title from there and take a look, also at solutions
- Or, if you are short on time you can find a list of all exercises per lesson from each lessons table of contents on the left side > Reference > List of exercises
- If anything is unclear or not working, please let us know by adding an issue to the corresponding GitHub repository (link is top right in each lesson)

If you have any questions about the lesson material, the workshop or other, or want to get involved in the CodeRefinery community, please join our CodeRefinery Zulip chat: https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com.
Please also let us know if you feel confused or unprepared for the workshop or have any open questions. Please write to support@coderefinery.org

We are looking forward to see you next week,
  Samantha and Radovan and the CodeRefinery team
