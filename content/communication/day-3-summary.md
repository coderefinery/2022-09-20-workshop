Dear all,

(Team representatives, could you please forward to your team(s)?)

Thank you so much for your active participation during the first week of the CodeRefinery workshop!

We are especially grateful to all the exercise leaders and expert helpers for their additional effort during the exercise sessions. We could not have a workshop of this scale without you!

We hope that our Git lessons have made you more comfortable using Git for your solo- and collaborative- projects. Of course, we would have loved to show a lot more if we had the time. If you have ideas on how to improve them (some ideas were already noted in the collaborative document), please open issues at https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/ or https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/, or even better, send us pull requests.

During next week we'll take best practices for software development to the next level, by learning about documentation, testing, reproducibility, software licensing, and more. We'll start using additional tools. If you have not yet set up your Conda environment, please do so during the following days: https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/conda-environment/.

If you'd like to receive a certificate of participation, please do not delete your Git repositories yet and please have a look at https://coderefinery.github.io/2022-09-20-workshop/#certificates-and-credits.

For planned exercises please watch the collaborative document. We will update them there but we are still refining things after your feedback.

Have a nice rest of the week and weekend and see you on Tuesday!
