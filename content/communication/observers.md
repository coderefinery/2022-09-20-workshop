Dear all,

Our CodeRefinery workshop starts soon and you have registered as observer:
- https://coderefinery.github.io/2022-09-20-workshop/

Thanks for doing that! Observers are often our future advocates. As observer you don't really
have to prepare and can show up anytime but we still want to make sure that you get all the links
so that you can observe the whole process. Your feedback will be very valuable.

The lessons will be streamed via Twitch in a web browser, no account needed:
- https://twitch.tv/coderefinery

However, exercise sessions happen somewhere else. Some groups have their own virtual or physical space but many groups use our Zoom exercise rooms:
- **(zoom link)**

We offer install help sessions that you are welcome to check out anytime during Sep 13 (Tuesday) or Sep 14 (Wednesday) 13:30 - 15:00 CEST at **(zoom link)**.

For exercise leads, we offer onboarding sessions Sep 13 (Tuesday) or Sep 14 (Wednesday) 12:00 - 13:00 CEST at **(zoom link)**. Again, you are most welcome to attend one of these.

Learners will use this collaborative document to ask questions during the workshop:

If you have any questions, please write to support@coderefinery.org.

Looking forward to see you there!

Best regards,

Radovan, and the CodeRefinery team
