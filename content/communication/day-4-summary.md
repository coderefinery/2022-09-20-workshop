Dear all,

I hope you enjoyed the workshop day with reproducible research and social coding lessons. We had a very active collaborative document. Thank you for keeping the questions rolling.

Tomorrow/today (sorry for the late email) we continue with Jupyter notebooks and code documentation. We will continue using the `coderefinery` environment again, so be sure to keep it.

For the Jupyter lesson, we plan these two exercises in groups:
- https://coderefinery.github.io/jupyter/first-notebook/#exercise
- https://coderefinery.github.io/jupyter/sharing/#sharing-dynamic-notebooks-on-binder

For the documentation lesson, we plan two exercise sessions:
- https://coderefinery.org/documentation/writing-readme-files/#exercises (exercise leads choose between README-1, README-2, or README-3)
- https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/sphinx/ (Sphinx-2; if time allows: Sphinx-3)

Stream starts 8:50 CEST: https://www.twitch.tv/coderefinery
- Collaborative document: (**notes**)
- Q&A archive: https://coderefinery.github.io/2022-09-20-workshop/questions/

See you tomorrow!

the CodeRefinery team
