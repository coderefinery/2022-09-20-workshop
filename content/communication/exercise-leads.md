Dear exercise leads,

TL;DR: two options for onboarding sessions Sep 13 (Tue) or Sep 14 (Wed) 12 - 13 CEST at **(zoom link)**. No problem if you cannot join; instructions will also be sent via email after.

Welcome soon to the CodeRefinery workshop:
- https://coderefinery.github.io/2022-09-20-workshop/

Thank you so much for joining as exercise lead! These workshops are only possible thanks to you and we really appreciate your help.

We ask all learners to prepare a software environment before the workshop:
- https://coderefinery.github.io/2022-09-20-workshop/requirements/

We offer install help sessions that you are welcome to attend anytime during Sep 13 (Tuesday) or Sep 14 (Wednesday) 13:30 - 15:00 CEST at **(zoom link)**.

If this is your first CodeRefinery workshop as exercise lead, we kindly ask you to attend our onboarding session for exercise leads Sep 13 (Tuesday) or Sep 14 (Wednesday) 12:00 - 13:00 CEST at **(zoom link)**. If we have your contact information and if you have indicated your availability, we will also send you a calendar invite. Some of you are unable to join any of the two sessions. Don't worry, we will send a summary email.

The lessons will be streamed via Twitch in a web browser, no account needed:
- https://twitch.tv/coderefinery

However, exercise sessions happen somewhere else: If you join as individual or as team who has requested that we provide a Zoom exercise room, then your group will meet for exercise sessions at **(zoom link)**. But maybe your team has their own virtual or physical room for exercises.

Learners will use this collaborative document to ask questions during the workshop and we encourage also exercise leads to raise questions/issues from their groups:
- **(hackmd link)**

If you have any questions, please write to support@coderefinery.org.

Looking forward to see you!

Best regards,

Samantha, Radovan, and the CodeRefinery team
