### Short text

Code Refinery invites everyone interested in "Research Software Engineering" activities to join Code Refinery Workshop on September 20.-22. and 27.-29. See https://coderefinery.github.io/2022-09-20-workshop/ for more details.

### Long text

Do you write code for your research? Do you manage data? 
Most importantly, are you doing it properly? 

If you answered yes to any of the previous questions, then you are strongly encouraged to participate to the free online CodeRefinery Workshop September 20.-22. and 27.-29.

Topics covered in the workshop include:
- Using git to maintain your codes and collaborate with others
- Principles of reproducible research and FAIR
- Good coding practices in general (writing documentation, testing, how to choose an appropriate license)

The Workshop will not teach you to code, but all the "good practice skills" that are needed to write good maintainable software and achieve reproducible research.

The workshop consists of streamed lectures and break-out room exercises where you will get to practice. Each breakout room will have an exercise leader to help you. 
You can also register as a team â€“ either in Code Refinery Zoom or by organising your own meeting.
If you already have some experience and would like to strengthen your skills and help others, you can also volunteer as an exercise leader or a teacher.
