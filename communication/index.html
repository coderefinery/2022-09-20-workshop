          <small>
            <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>Thank you for being an exercise leader for the CodeRefinery workshop starting next week :heart:</p>
<p>The information below is for those who could not join the exercise leader on-boarding session but also hopefully a useful summary for those who have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone will watch the course via Twitch stream (https://twitch.tv/coderefinery) showing the instructors going through the material</li>
<li>Some of you registered as a team, you will stay together during the duration of the workshop, and if you are participating via our learner zoom [1], you will find your team in a breakoutroom named after your team (used during registration)</li>
<li>For those who did not register as a team, you can join one of the open rooms called open-group-X at [1]</li>
<li>There will also be rooms named help-room-X which can be used for one-on-one help, if needed</li>
<li>Whether your team is in a physical or virtual space, you will spend time with the learners during exercise sessions, and help learners getting through exercises, by answering or relaying questions to HackMD (see below), keeping the time and creating a positive learning environment.</li>
<li>Exercises are distributed all through the lesson material and we will have 2-3 exercises per half-day, a detailed schedule (with approximate exercise times) will be available in HackMD during the course</li>
<li>Exercises will be typically 15-20 minutes (sometimes more) to give the group time to orient</li>
<li>HackMD is our collaborative document [2] for the course and we use it to:
<ul>
<li>ask and answer questions</li>
<li>communicate with instructors in stream (they don't see/hear learners)</li>
<li>ask for help</li>
<li>communicate breakout room status during exercises</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can read more about how we use HackMD here: https://coderefinery.org/manuals/hackmd-mechanics/</li>
<li>You can find all this information and much more in our manuals: https://coderefinery.org/manuals/exercise-leaders/</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing you can do before the workshop to prepare is to have a look at exercises for each lesson:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can find all lesson material from the links in the schedule: https://coderefinery.github.io/2022-09-20-workshop/schedule/</li>
<li>You can either go through the material and find the green boxes with Exercise title from there and take a look, also at solutions</li>
<li>Or, if you are short on time you can find a list of all exercises per lesson from each lessons table of contents on the left side &gt; Reference &gt; List of exercises</li>
<li>If anything is unclear or not working, please let us know by adding an issue to the corresponding GitHub repository (link is top right in each lesson)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions about the lesson material, the workshop or other, or want to get involved in the CodeRefinery community, please join our CodeRefinery Zulip chat: https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com.
Please also let us know if you feel confused or unprepared for the workshop or have any open questions. Please write to support@coderefinery.org</p>
<p>We are looking forward to see you next week,
Samantha and Radovan and the CodeRefinery team</p>

            <p>Dear exercise leads,</p>
<p>TL;DR: two options for onboarding sessions Sep 13 (Tue) or Sep 14 (Wed) 12 - 13 CEST at <strong>(zoom link)</strong>. No problem if you cannot join; instructions will also be sent via email after.</p>
<p>Welcome soon to the CodeRefinery workshop:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://coderefinery.github.io/2022-09-20-workshop/</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you so much for joining as exercise lead! These workshops are only possible thanks to you and we really appreciate your help.</p>
<p>We ask all learners to prepare a software environment before the workshop:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://coderefinery.github.io/2022-09-20-workshop/requirements/</li>
</ul>
<p>We offer install help sessions that you are welcome to attend anytime during Sep 13 (Tuesday) or Sep 14 (Wednesday) 13:30 - 15:00 CEST at <strong>(zoom link)</strong>.</p>
<p>If this is your first CodeRefinery workshop as exercise lead, we kindly ask you to attend our onboarding session for exercise leads Sep 13 (Tuesday) or Sep 14 (Wednesday) 12:00 - 13:00 CEST at <strong>(zoom link)</strong>. If we have your contact information and if you have indicated your availability, we will also send you a calendar invite. Some of you are unable to join any of the two sessions. Don't worry, we will send a summary email.</p>
<p>The lessons will be streamed via Twitch in a web browser, no account needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://twitch.tv/coderefinery</li>
</ul>
<p>However, exercise sessions happen somewhere else: If you join as individual or as team who has requested that we provide a Zoom exercise room, then your group will meet for exercise sessions at <strong>(zoom link)</strong>. But maybe your team has their own virtual or physical room for exercises.</p>
<p>Learners will use this collaborative document to ask questions during the workshop and we encourage also exercise leads to raise questions/issues from their groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(hackmd link)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Schedule and lecture material:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://coderefinery.github.io/2022-09-20-workshop/schedule/</li>

<p>Looking forward to see you!</p>

            <p>dear all, (team representatives can you please forward?)</p>
<p>Thank you for joining the workshop on day 1! We had some &quot;excitement&quot; with HackMD, but it looks like our new solution [1] works nicely and we will use this tomorrow also.</p>
<p><strong>Info about day 1 and day 2</strong></p>
<p>Day 2 continues with more advanced features of Git: We'll go over conflicts, sharing repositories, looking at history, and other practical matters. If day 1 was a review of Git basics, day 2 will go into new things.</p>
<p>If you didn't join us in day 1, it's not too late.  Day 1 covered basics of git, up to branching and merging.  If you follow through that, you will have what you need to continue. We will also offer a quick solution to catch up if you didn't join us today.</p>
<p>If you don't have a team, please see the next session to request access for an exercise tomorrow.</p>
<p>Link to videos, Q&amp;A, and more news can be found on our website:
https://coderefinery.github.io/2022-09-20-workshop/</p>
<p><strong>Information for stream participants who practice on their own</strong></p>
<p>On Thursday we will all practice how to collaborate using Git/GitHub [2] and one
ambitious thing we will try is to collaborate with participants following
via stream. This does not apply to teams and exercise groups who will create their
own exercise repositories and these groups can ignore the rest of this section.</p>
<p>For this to work we will need to give you access to a practice repository.  This is option, you could just watch instead. We delete these repositories after the workshop and will not use your username for anything other than this exercise.</p>
<p>If you would like to participate in this, could you please open an issue here.  Give any title like &quot;please add me&quot; and then click submit:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise/issues/new</li>
</ul>
<p>Example for how I requested access:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise/issues/1</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Information to exercise leads</strong></p>
<p>Since we are so spread over different in-person/zoom and breakout-room sessions, it is very appreciated if you can give us feedback how today went in your &quot;team&quot;. You can use the HackMD feedback section for that. What can we improve?</p>
<p>We will continue tomorrow with the material in git-intro (https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/), starting from https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/conflicts/. </p>
<p>We plan two exercise sessions:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/archaeology/#exercise-basic-archaeology-commands</li>
<li>https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/recovering/#exercise-revert-a-commit (and exercises on same page)</li>

<p><strong>Info about day 3</strong></p>
<p>We continue with &quot;collaborative git&quot;, where you will really see how git comes together in teams.  You'll see the method for both small teams, and large projects.  People who know some git can easily start joining this day - invite your colleagues!</p>

            <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>(Team representatives, could you please forward to your team(s)?)</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your active participation during the first week of the CodeRefinery workshop!</p>
<p>We are especially grateful to all the exercise leaders and expert helpers for their additional effort during the exercise sessions. We could not have a workshop of this scale without you!</p>
<p>We hope that our Git lessons have made you more comfortable using Git for your solo- and collaborative- projects. Of course, we would have loved to show a lot more if we had the time. If you have ideas on how to improve them (some ideas were already noted in the collaborative document), please open issues at https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/ or https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/, or even better, send us pull requests.</p>
<p>During next week we'll take best practices for software development to the next level, by learning about documentation, testing, reproducibility, software licensing, and more. We'll start using additional tools. If you have not yet set up your Conda environment, please do so during the following days: https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/conda-environment/.</p>
<p>If you'd like to receive a certificate of participation, please do not delete your Git repositories yet and please have a look at https://coderefinery.github.io/2022-09-20-workshop/#certificates-and-credits.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed the workshop day with reproducible research and social coding lessons. We had a very active collaborative document. Thank you for keeping the questions rolling.</p>
<p>Tomorrow/today (sorry for the late email) we continue with Jupyter notebooks and code documentation. We will continue using the <code>coderefinery</code> environment again, so be sure to keep it.</p>
<p>For the Jupyter lesson, we plan these two exercises in groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://coderefinery.github.io/jupyter/first-notebook/#exercise</li>
<li>https://coderefinery.github.io/jupyter/sharing/#sharing-dynamic-notebooks-on-binder</li>
</ul>
<p>For the documentation lesson, we plan two exercise sessions:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://coderefinery.org/documentation/writing-readme-files/#exercises (exercise leads choose between README-1, README-2, or README-3)</li>
<li>https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/sphinx/ (Sphinx-2; if time allows: Sphinx-3)</li>

            <p>dear all,</p>
<p>We are quickly approaching the final day of the workshop. Thank you again for the active participation.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we will go through software testing and modular code development. I hope we can convey to you why testing and modularity can be important ingredients to manage code complexity and to improve reusability of your code for you and for others. We will need the Conda environment again. No new tools.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we plan two exercise sessions:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/pytest/</li>
<li>https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/test-design/ (any of the design exercises)</li>
</ul>
<p>The modular code development session will be done as demo/&quot;improv&quot; but we will try to make it really engaging and we hope you ask lots of questions and give us many comments via the collaborative document.</p>
<p>After the modular session, if you have time and are interested, we plan an informal and optional
&quot;meet the instructors&quot; and ask-us-anything/ discussion session after 12:30 CEST in (<strong>link</strong>).</p>
